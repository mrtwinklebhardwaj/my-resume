                    I'm Twinkle Bhardwaj, a self-taught UI Engineer and Frontend Developer based in Noida, India. I specialize in building
                    high-performance, design-driven web applications using modern frontend technologies like React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
                    With over 5 years of experience, Iâ€™ve led development across multiple products and design systems, collaborating closely
                    with designers, backend engineers, and product teams to deliver scalable, intuitive interfaces.
                </p>

                    My passion lies in crafting clean UI architecture, building reusable components, and enhancing user experience through thoughtful
                    interactions and performance optimization. Outside of coding, I love exploring design patterns, storytelling through tech, and mentoring upcoming developers.
